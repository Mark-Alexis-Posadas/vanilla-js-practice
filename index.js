// Addition Function:
// Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
function calculateSum(paramOne, paramTwo) {
  let sum = paramOne + paramTwo;
  return sum;
}
console.log(calculateSum(20, 3));

// Subtraction Function:
// Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their difference.

// Multiplication Function:
// Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their product.

// Division Function:
// Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their quotient. Ensure to handle division by zero gracefully.

// Check Even or Odd:
// Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.

// Max of Three Numbers:
// Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters and returns the largest of them.

// Grade Assignment:
// Write a function that takes a student's score as a parameter and returns their grade based on the following criteria:
//     Score >= 90: A
//     80 <= Score < 90: B
//     70 <= Score < 80: C
//     60 <= Score < 70: D
//     Score < 60: F

// Leap Year Checker:
// Write a function that takes a year as a parameter and returns true if it's a leap year, otherwise false. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

// Absolute Value:
// Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns its absolute value.

// Check Triangle Type:
// Write a function that takes three numbers (representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle) as parameters and returns:
//     "Equilateral" if all three sides are equal.
//     "Isosceles" if exactly two sides are equal.
//     "Scalene" if all sides are different lengths.
